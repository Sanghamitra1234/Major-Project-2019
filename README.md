# Major-Project-2019
This was our major project for 8th sem of B.Tech in CSE.
# Project Title :
Election Prediction using Twitter Sentiment Analysis.
## About:
In this project we can search tweets and set the max tweet to nearly 5000 (as we tried to implement twitter api, by increasing their tweets, which was not present directly in their API). Then it will show the positive, negative and neutral percentage.
In case the no. of tweets given as input is not available for the query given, it will show error.
## Getting Started:
To run this in your local server, you need to
1. install python3.7 (recent version).
2. install pip3
3. pip3 install -- (flask, matplotlib,tweepy,pickle,nltk)
4. This app is deployed in heroku server. So you should read its documentation, in order to deploy your own.

## Caution :
